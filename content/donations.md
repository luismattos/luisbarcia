If you enjoy what I do here — the articles, projects, tutorials or any other content — you can support my work. It helps me keep the site running and dedicate more time to creating useful stuff.

I don't like filling the site with ads and pop-ups. I prefer support to be voluntary, from those who really want to contribute.

## One-time donation

### Ko-fi

The simplest way to support. No fees, straight to the coffee fund.

### Pix

If you prefer, you can send a Pix (Brazil only):

`PIX_KEY_HERE`

### Crypto

**Monero (XMR)**

`YOUR_XMR_ADDRESS`

**Bitcoin (BTC)**

`YOUR_BTC_ADDRESS`

## Recurring donation

If you want to support on an ongoing basis, Liberapay allows recurring donations that help maintain stable support.

## Referring links

Another way to support is by using my referral links for services I use. It costs you nothing extra and gives me a small return.

Every bit helps. Thanks!
