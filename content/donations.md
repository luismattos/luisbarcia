At the end of the day, it’s always about the money…

If you like what I am doing on the internet - my articles, websites, tutorials, projects and other stuff - you can support my work. This will help me to realise my ideas and help me to spend more time developing the site and projects.

All financial donations will go towards server maintenance first, then coffee and donuts!

I do not want to overwhelm people with ads and pop-ups. It is not meant to work that way. If you want to support the site, you will do so voluntarily, not by wading through ads to get what you want.

If I have helped you in the past, you can now return the favour.

You can support me in several ways.

Before you make a donation, make sure that the address in your browser is for the Tor network (focus on the last characters before .onion), also my Onion URL starts with HTTPS:

{{< figure align=center src="/images/profile-img.png" >}}

and for Clearnet:

{{< figure align=center src="/images/profile-img.png" >}}

In addition, both legitimate domains have a TLS certificate and the address should start with https. There are unfortunately already phishing clones of my site.

## Cryptocurrency Donations

One of the donation options is the transfer of cryptocurrencies. Here are my addresses. If you can’t see your favorite crypto-currency you can always use free on-line exchange. XMR, XLM, DASH, LTC and SOL are great, they have low fees and are fast. BTC is not bad and ETH sucks. In the end both are slow and expensive. So if you have a choice send something, start from the top of the list.
